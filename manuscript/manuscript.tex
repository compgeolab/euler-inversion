\section{Classical theory of implicit models (old stuff)}

Show the basic derivation of the combined adjustment in Krakiwsky's lecture
notes:
\url{http://www2.unb.ca/gge/Pubs/LN42.pdf} and
\url{http://www2.unb.ca/gge/Pubs/LN18.pdf}.

Derive equations for the combined adjustment with and without $\delta^T\delta$.

Note that the observed data $\mathbf{l}$
are only included
as the initial estimate
for the predicted data $\mathbf{d}^0$.
So after the first iteration
the observed data are not present
in any of the equations.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Adaptations (need better name for this) (new stuff)}

Formulate the adjustment using $r^Tr$.
Show that the Gauss-Newton method
for non-linear problems
is a particular case of $B = -I$.
Show that the linear problem
is a particular case of $A$ not depending on $p$
and $p^0 = 0$.

Formulate the adjustment with $\delta^T\delta$
and show that the method of Marquardt
is a particular case of this.



\subsection{Regularization}

Add Tikhonov regularization to the combined adjustment derived above.



\subsection{Calculating synthetic data}

Show how to use Newton's root finding method to calculate predicted data from a
given $p$. Only valid when $L = N$.

Show least squares solution for under- and over-determined problems using
$f^tf$.

\section{Implicit models in geophysics}

Give examples here of implicit models.
If only one example


\subsubsection{Heat flow  at the base of the crust}

\subsubsection{Love wave dispersion}

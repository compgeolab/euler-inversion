## Geology and Aeromagnetic Survey

The shapefiles and aeromagnetic survey data were obtained from the 
[Brazilian Geological Survey](https://geosgb.sgb.gov.br/) (Serviço Geológico 
Brasileiro - SGB). The data is publicly available under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License, allowing for use and 
modification for non-commercial purposes. 

### Aeromagnetic Survey
The [aeromagnetic data](https://geosgb.sgb.gov.br/downloads/) were collected 
in two phases in 1978. Subarea 1 was surveyed from March 25 to May 27 using 
an Islander aircraft, and Subarea 2 from April 6 to July 19 using a Bandeirante 
aircraft, both funded by the Brazilian government. The survey followed a grid with 
1 km spaced north-south flight lines and east-west tie lines, recording data every 
100 meters with a Geometrics G-803 magnetometer.

### Shapefiles
The [shapefiles](https://rigeo.sgb.gov.br/handle/doc/20479) represent the geology 
of the NE-ENE trending Ribeira Belt (RB), formed during the Brasiliano orogeny. 
The RB comprises older basement high-grade metamorphic rocks, Neoproterozoic to 
Cambrian/Ordovician granitoid magmatism, and Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene magmatism 
that resulted in basic dike swarms and alkaline intrusions.
